          <summary>Node.js</summary>
          <h4>What is Node.js</h4>
          <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, backend JavaScript runtime environment that
              runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.</p>
          <p>In short, it is JavaScript that can do a lot of incredible things. It is very commonly
              used for backend web development. We have the frontend which consists of HTML, CSS and a
              bit of JavaScript. We also have some sort of database where data is stored long-term.
              And we have some backend system that will connect the frontend to the database. This is
              what we will use Node for in this class. </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Open the official page for <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js downloads</a> and download Node.js for your
                  operating system.</li>
              <li>Run the downloaded Node.js Installer, including accepting the license, selecting the
                  destination, and authenticating for the install. <i>This requires Administrator
                      privileges, and you may need to authenticate.</i></li>
              <li>To ensure Node.js has been installed, run node -v in your terminalâ€”you should get
                  something like vx.x.x</li>
              <li>Update your version of npm with npm install npm --global. <i>This requires
                      Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate</i></li>
              <li>Congratulations! You now have Node.js installed and are ready to start building!
              </li>
          </ol>

      <details>
          <summary>YouTube</summary>
          <p>Almost all of your code assignment submissions in this class will include a YouTube video
              link. You will use this video as an opportunity to demonstrate the tasks mentioned
              within the rubric of the individual assignments. As part of the course setup for this
              class, please ensure that you have a YouTube account created. If you need help doing
              this, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+create+a+YouTube+account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Google search for how to create a
                  YouTube account may help</a>.</p>
          <p>If you have never recorded a video of you sharing your screen while recording your voice,
              that is okay. There are many free resources that allow you to create such recordings.
              Here are a few popular ones:</p>

          <summary>Git</summary>
          <p>GitHub is essentially a big database of source code for people all around the world. You
              can make your source code public or private and configure many different permissions and
              settings. Each project has its own repository, or "repo". This repository will be a
              clone of the one on your local computer. Thus, you will have three copies of your code:
          </p><ul>
              <li>On your computer</li>
              <li>GitHub</li>
              <li>Render (where you will host your application)</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Install Git</h4>
          <!-- <p>
              If you already have git
                      installed, you can skip the first  installation and proceed to create a new repository below.
          </p> -->
          <ol>
              <li>Go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">git-scm.com</a> and choose the appropriate download
                  for your operating system.</li>
              <li>Run the installer with the default settings (Windows: ensure that git will be added
                  to PATH) and wait for the installation to finish.</li>
              <li>Restart VS Code if you have it open, and open a new terminal window by selecting New
                  Terminal inside of the Terminal menu.</li>
              <li>In your terminal, execute <code>git --version</code>.</li>
              <li>If "git --version" produces an error, make sure git has been <a href="https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added to your PATH environment
                      variable</a>, then restart VS Code.<div class="global_tips__H-r7G">
                      <p>Instructor Tip:</p>
                      <p>On Windows, Git is usually installed at
                          <code>C:\Program Files\Git\cmd</code>. This is the location that should be
                          added to your PATH.</p>

        <h4>Create a new GitHub repository</h4>


        <h5>Setting up GitHub</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub.com</a> and sign up for a new account if you
                    haven't already. If you already have an account, that is perfect, you can use it here.
                </li>
                <li>After creating an account, return to GitHub.com and sign in. In the upper right corner
                    of the screen you should see a "+" icon. Click this and select "New Repository".</li>
                <li>Choose a name for your repository (likely cse341-node or something similar).</li>
                <li>Leave the repo public and do not check the box for a readme. Leave .gitignore and
                    license as "none".<div>
                        <p>Instructor Tip:</p>
                        <p>It's not technically a problem if you add these other files now, but it makes it
                            a little more difficult when you go to push to GitHub for the first time,
                            because you'll have conflicts that you'll have to resolve. So at this point,
                            it's easiest to leave everything blank.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Click the button to create the repository.</li>
                <li>On the page that follows, you should see a URL for your new repository (e.g.,
                    "https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git"). Copy this URL for use later on.</li>
            </ol>

          <h4>What is MongoDB?</h4>
          <p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program.
              Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional
              schemas.</p>
          <p>For all of our projects this semester, our database for our data will be MongoDB.</p>
          <h4>Create MongoDB Account and Cluster</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a> Site
              </li>
              <li>Select <b>Start Free</b></li>
              <li>Fill out your email, name, and password to create an account.</li>
              <li>Choose the free option and select <b>Create a Cluster</b></li>
              <li>Ensure that the configurations for the new cluster look similar to the following
                  image and have the free options selected.</li><img src="./CSE 341 _ Course Setup_files/01_atlas_settings.png" class="global_imgTutorial__gBTRe" alt="MongoDB Atlas Settings">
              <li>Your account is now ready to go. You will not need to create another database
                  account or cluster. During the semester, you will be able to add collections of data
                  and manage this database, so make bookmarks where needed.</li>

          <h4>Deploying an API</h4>
          <p>A deployed API is the code is hosted and built on a platform away from your computer so that
            anyone and anything can access it via a public URL.</p>
        <p>Deploying an API to be accessible anywhere is very similar to deploying any website. There
            are fewer options for deploying a backend compared to comparing a frontend, but there are
            many tools available to do this. Below is a list of several popular ones, but there are many
            more and they fluctuate frequently.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A2 Hosting</li>
                            <li>Heroku</li>
                            <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
                            <li>DigitalOcean</li>
                            <li>Glitch</li>
                            <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
                            <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
                            <li>Platform.sh</li>
                            <li>NodeChef</li>

                            <li>Fly</li>
                            <li>Railway</li>
                            <li>Vercel</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Why Render?</h4>

                       <p>For this course, we will be using Render because it...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>...has a great free tier for API deployments with Node.js</li>
                            <li>...doesn't require a credit card up front</li>
                            <li>...supports Node.js and has a strong community</li>
                            <li>...supports automatic deploys from git providers like GitHub</li>
                            <li>...easily deploys Node.js APIs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>According to <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Render's
                                website</a>, Render is a unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites with
                            free TLS certificates, a global CDN, DDoS protection, private networks, and auto deploys
                            from Git.</p>
                        <p>For this class, we will use it to deploy our web projects to the internet so that they can be
                            accessed by anyone.</p>

                    <h4>Account Setup</h4>
                        <h5>Create a Render Account</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>If you don't have a GitHub account yet, please <a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create one now</a>. All information/videos
